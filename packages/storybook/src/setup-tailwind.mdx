# Tailwind CSS setup guide

We provide a Tailwind CSS 4 theme that you can use to access colors, typography,
spacing, and other design tokens defined in our design system. The theme also
removes Tailwind's default tokens so that you don't accidentally use them.

## Install the package

To use the theme, first install the `@scouterna/tailwind-theme` package. It can
be installed as a development dependency since it's only needed during build
time.

```bash
pnpm install -D @scouterna/tailwind-theme
```

You also need to load the Source Sans 3 font under the name `"Source Sans 3
Variable"`. We recommend you get it through Fontsource:

```bash
pnpm install @fontsource-variable/source-sans-3
```

## Usage

In your style file where you import Tailwind CSS you must:
- Import our Tailwind theme.
- Import the Source Sans 3 font.
- Set the correct defaults on the body element.

This is how your style file could look like:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@scouterna/tailwind-theme";

@import "@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3";

body {
  font-family: "Source Sans 3 Variable", sans-serif;
  font-size: var(--text-body-base);
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: var(--color-text-base);
}
```

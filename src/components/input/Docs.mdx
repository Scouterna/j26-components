# Input

The Input component is used to retrieve user input.

Note that the Input component has no `placeholder` prop. Placeholders are
generally considered bad accessibility practice since the placeholder text
disappears when the user starts typing. It's also hard to design them in such a
way that the text has sufficient contrast. Instead, use the
[FormField](?path=/story/components-form-field--with-input) component to show a
descriptive label for the input.

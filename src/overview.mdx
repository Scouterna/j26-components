# Scouterna UI

This UI library is designed to be used in applications developed by the The
Guides and Scouts of Sweden (Scouterna). It provides components, configurations
and utilities to ease the development of user interfaces that are consistent
with the Scouterna brand and design.

This UI library intentionally deviates from Scouternas graphical profile and
expands on it to better suit the needs of application interfaces.

The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/scouterna/ui).

# Scouterna UI

This UI library is designed to be used in applications developed by the The
Guides and Scouts of Sweden (Scouterna). It provides components, configuration
and utilities to ease the development of user interfaces that are consistent
with the Scouterna brand and design.

This UI library intentionally deviates from Scouternas graphical profile and
expands on it to better suit the needs of application interfaces.

The source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/scouterna/ui).

## Styling

To use the provided styles yourself, setup your Tailwind CSS like this:

```css
// Import Tailwind CSS
@import "tailwindcss";
// Import the Scouterna UI theme
@import "@scouterna/ui-react/theme.css";

// Set base text color to make your own text coherent with the theme
@layer base {
  html {
    @apply text-gray-dark;
  }
}
```
